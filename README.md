# CS-370
The project provided all of the code for the GameExperience and TreasureMaze Python files. The TreasureHuntGame Jupyter notebook file provided the majority of the code. 
The section of code that I was responsible for controlled the neural network and rewards for the Q-training used in the training of the intelligent agent. Computer 
scientists approach machine learning to mimic the learning that humans do when solving similar problems. I typically approach most programming by running the provided 
code without making any changes to see how the program works. For this project that was not possible I read through each of the files provided and made notes of what 
functions and processes were being used and what they did. This allowed me to identify how the provided pseudocode was supposed to be written as code to utilize the
provided files. I also had to refer to the provided course materials to assist in writing the training loop of the neural network. I did make an error originally in the
development of the loop that prevented the training loop from training the model effectively. I forgot to include 2 of the 4 parameters of the model-to-fit function that 
informed the training of the batch size and episodes to train on. After correcting that the model was able to solve the maze effectively.
